This is a simple game where you can run around using a gamepad/joystick or the keyboard and shoot your friends (and enemies).

Each player uses a unique device. Connect the device and press "configure a controller" from the main menu. Once in the configuration screen, press buttons or use axes to set up the controls. Note that some controllers are pre-configured.
